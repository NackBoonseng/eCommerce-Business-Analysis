# eCommerce Business Analysis
In today's data-driven business environment, effective decision-making relies heavily on analyzing large datasets to uncover trends, optimize strategies, and improve business outcomes. **This project is vital as it focuses on eCommerce data analysis, a critical component for businesses looking to remain competitive in the digital marketplace**. By analyzing traffic, sales, customer behaviors, and product performance using advanced SQL techniques, businesses can generate actionable insights that drive growth, enhance customer experience, and optimize marketing spend.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Understanding Customer Behavior: This project aims to analyze **traffic sources** (e.g., social media, search engines, email campaigns) to see where customers are coming from, and how these sources convert into sales. Also, analyzing the **conversion rate** of each traffic source can significantly help the business understand which campaigns are working and which areas require improvement.
- Optimizing Marketing Spend: The project helps businesses understand **channel performance**, determining which channels deliver the best return on investment (ROI). Using an SQL query comparing **session volumes, conversion rates, and cost-per-click (CPC)** across channels enables the marketing team to optimize bids and allocate budgets more efficiently, reducing waste and maximizing profit.
